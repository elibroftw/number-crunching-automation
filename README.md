# Number Crunching Automation

A bunch of scripts that automate number crunching for various fields like Math, Physics, and Chemistry

Finance scripts have been moved to [elibroftw/python-finance-library](https://github.com/elibroftw/python-finance-library/) to keep alongside the investing.py script I made in 2020, and any future analysis strategies I want to implement.
